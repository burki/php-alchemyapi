# AlchemyAPI

## Installation

```
{
	"require": {
		"jadb/alchemyapi": "1.*"
	}
}
```

## Credits

Initially inspired by the [official SDK](https://github.com/AlchemyAPI/alchemyapi_php)
and an [abandoned composer package](https://github.com/alanchavez88/alchemy-api).

*I like to believe this one is better :)*
